Maybe it's unkind of me, but I'm surprised at how slick Effective Altruism has become.

When I arrived at the [Examination Schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Examination_Schools), a greeter gave me a plastic name badge, a t-shirt and "a copy of [Will's book](http://www.effectivealtruism.com/)". I headed into the South Schools, which was dark except for a white fill lighting up the stage. The two co-organisers of the conference ran on stage, wearing headset mics, to cheers and applause. They gave a brief introduction, before yielding to Will MacAskill and Toby Ord, who in turn gave a sort of 'state of the nation' summary of where the movement had got to.

It was pretty impressive. More than 2,000 people have taken the Giving What We Can pledge, and they're approaching an estimated $1bn in money pledged.

- group session on motivation
- talking to wm in the pub
- new people met
- demography

To anyone hesistant about applying to the next EA Global event: go. Meet your people. You won't regret it.
