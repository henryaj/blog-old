Or, _Morocco for Dummies_.

Expect to be hassled. Endlessly. By everyone. In fact, plan your route before you leave your riad.

If people talk to you, flatly ignore them. They will tell you any lie if it leads to you giving them money: "that way is closed" (it isn't); "the big square is this way" (it's not); "ah, I know where X is" (he doesn't). Even six-year-old girls practicing speaking French will say "dirham! dirham!" as you walk away. Expect a few "fuck you"s â€“ all part of the game, of course, as if you turn round to offer a riposte you signal you're an English-speaker and a target for more harassment.
