Or, _Two gweilos in Marrakech_.

## Marrakech

It's worth paying for a taxi from the airport in advance.

Expect to be hassled. Endlessly. By everyone. In fact, plan your route before you leave your [riad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_riad) -- which will become an oasis of calm in the médina.

If people talk to you, flatly ignore them. They will tell you any lie if it leads to you giving them money: "that way is closed" (it isn't); "the big square is this way" (it's not); "ah, I know where X is" (he doesn't). Even six-year-old girls practicing speaking French will say "dirham! dirham!" as you walk away. Expect a few "fuck you"s – all part of the game, of course, as if you turn round to offer a riposte you signal you're an English-speaker and a target for more harassment.

Get out and go to the Atlas Mountains. Wear your seatbelt if you don't want the police to stop you and fine you[^seatbelts].

[^seatbelts]: Needless to say, this isn't about safety -- none of the taxis have working seatbelts.

## Rabat

Couldn't be more different. A quiet, cool seaside city.

Still, you have to use basic economic theory to your advantage. A taxi driver taking people from the médina to the new town can carry three passengers at 5Dh each; if you offer 15Dh they'll take you. Maybe 20Dh if you don't want them to wait around for other passengers.

Insist on giving the correct money at the end of your ride. One driver insisted on getting 15Dh from each of us -- when I noted, sharply, that "[j'ai dit quinze pour tous les deux](https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/j'ai%20dit%20quinze%20pour%20tous%20les%20deux)", he was silent. Threaten to call the police if you are being extorted; taxi drivers are terrified of having their license revoked.

People talked to me on the street -- this time to say hello to a foreigner. One man told me about his work running a naturalisation centre for migrants to Morocco, teaching them Arabic and inculcating them with the culture.

## Fez

A blend of the two. Calmer than Marrakech, but with enough harassment to be annoying.
