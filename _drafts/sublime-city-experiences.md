<div class="copy">Help me find unusual and sublime experiences that others might not think of as 'things to do'.

Watching the [Eurostar hum its way into the baby blue train shed at Kings Cross St Pancras](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Eurostar_trains_at_St_Pancras.jpg). Sitting on a giant cushion in the [Wellcome Collection reading room](https://wellcomecollection.org/readingroom). The way the [U1 train rushes over the bridge through Alte Donau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Donau_(Vienna_U-Bahn)). The eerily beautiful sculptures and buildings of [Broadgate Circle](http://www.broadgate.co.uk/Content/Images/EventOrganiser/circle11.jpg).  

These are all intriguing things to see – but few guidebooks seem to mention them. They're sort of sublime experiences, but not exactly 'attractions' or 'things to do'.
