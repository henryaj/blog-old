Basecamp recently announced a no politics at work policy. Employees are requested not to post about or discuss politics on the company Basecamp account.

Coinbase did this a few months ago, describing it as a shift towards becoming a 'mission-focused company' (i.e. one not distracted with polarising political discussions at work).
