The Omicron variant of Covid is much more infectious than Delta, and likely less lethal still (Delta already being less lethal than previous variants).

As of the end of 2021, cases are rising incredibly quickly and we're likely heading for a lockdown in January.

But for most young people (say under 40), I'm not convinced it's worth going to extreme measures to avoid it.

I already know lots of people who have had it. Avoiding getting it before Christmas so you can enjoy the festive season with vulnerable family members seems very sensible; I even checked into an Airbnb for a few nights when I learned my housemate had tested positive so that I could get a PCR test and be sure I hadn't been infected in the interim. That meant I could go home for Christmas and enjoy it with my family – especially important as I'd had to stay away last year because of last-minute movement restrictions.

But after the festive season is over, it's not clear that young people should be so careful. The risk of serious illness from Covid is now lower than ever. The [ONS revised down their estimates of the prevalence of long Covid from 12% to 3%](https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2021/09/16/how-common-is-long-covid-that-depends-on-how-you-measure-it/); this will likely be lower with Omicron and now that effective therapies like Paxlovid are available.

Omicron is _fantastically_ infectious. To successfully avoid it, you'll need to go to incredible lengths – certainly no trips to the pub or to restaurants, no big events, no going into the office. Likely the little lockdown-breaking things people did last time round would be strictly forbidden, so no dinners at your place or having sex with people you don't live with.

I don't think this trade-off is worth it. Perhaps it was for previous variants, but not for this one. We've already spent two years of our lives in various states of lockdown; once you're vaccinated and boostered, the payoff from such extreme measures is likely quite small, and the cost very large. I'm not willing to indefinitely forgo all the things that make life fun.

In future, Covid will likely become endemic – another flu or common cold which everyone gets now and then, which we can have vaccines against but which we can't develop long-term immunity, so will never be eliminated. Given that [it's going to be with us forever](https://twitter.com/timcolbourn/status/1473425295319384064), we can't continue putting everything on hold. There's presumably a point at which the sign of the cost-benefit ratio flips and it makes sense to just take the calculated risk – after the crisis of the next month or so is past, I think that point will have come.
