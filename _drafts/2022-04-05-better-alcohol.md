One of the most popular drugs

Alcohol is the world's most popular drug. It's a central part of many cultures, especially here in the UK. Weddings, birthday parties, work drinks all have alcohol as a key component. People share war stories of hangovers from hell and hazy nights out. 

It's popular because it's fun, and because it's easy to make. Alcohol is just a byproduct of yeast fermenting anaerobically. 

Popular because it's easy to make. In fact, it's basically impossible to ban - you'd have to ban fermentation 
Complex relationship with alcohol - enzymes required to break it down 
But a terrible drug. Essentially, we drink a solvent for fun. Not rationally designed, but a simple compound that binds to our GABA receptors and makes us feel good
Because it's not rationally designed, it has all sorts of negative effects. Hangovers, vomiting, addiction
Estimating suffering caused by alcohol - deaths + hangovers
Could we make something better? Work through drug families 
Benzodiazepines 
Barbiturates
GHB

See what David nutt is working on - has he published any papers? 

Then move on to other recreational drugs - they mostly aren't rationally designed so what about them
