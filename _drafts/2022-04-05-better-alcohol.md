One of the most popular drugs

Alcohol is the world's most popular drug. It's a central part of many cultures, especially here in the UK. Weddings, birthday parties, work drinks all have alcohol as a key component. People share war stories of hangovers from hell and hazy nights out. 

It's popular because it's fun, and because it's easy to make. Alcohol is just a byproduct of yeast fermenting anaerobically. In fact, it's basically impossible to ban - you'd have to ban fermentation. Perhaps this is why so prohibition failed; if the populace has access to all the materials needed to make an illegal drug that they want, it's tricky to get much traction in banning it.

Unfortunately, alcohol is a terrible drug.

Terrible not just in the side-effects it has, but terrible in the sense that it's just _not a well-designed drug_.

Drug companies pour billions of dollars into screening molecules to find good drug candidates. These candidate compounds should ideally have a high affinity for whatever thing they're meant to interact with, and low affinity for everything else. Tamoxifen, a breast cancer drug, binds tightly to estrogen receptors in breast tissue, blocking the growth of cancer cells which depend on estrogen, but weakly with estrogen receptors elsewhere in the body. This reduces the anti-estrogenic side effects it might otherwise have.

Alcohol is a tiny molecule, really more solvent than drug. It gets everywhere and binds to everything. That explains its complex and wide-ranging constellation of effects and side effects, and also explains why, compared to rationally-designed molecules, it's so crap at its job.

Four bottles of wine can contain a lethal dose of alcohol for the average adult. Consider that you might drink half a bottle of wine in a sitting - so the ratio between the "effective dose" and the lethal dose is 8. Compare that to SSRI antidepressants, where [doses 75 times higher than the normal dose](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9786310/) are fatal only in combination with other drugs (usually alcohol).



Estimating suffering caused by alcohol - deaths + hangovers
Could we make something better? Work through drug families 
Benzodiazepines 
Barbiturates
GHB

See what David nutt is working on - has he published any papers? 

Then move on to other recreational drugs - they mostly aren't rationally designed so what about them
