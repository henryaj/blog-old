I'm a founder and CTO of fintech startup <a href="https://usemast.com">Mast</a>.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Projects

<em>
  I'm not actively working on these.
</em>

* [Let's Fund](http://lets-fund.org) is a crowdfunding site I started with [Hauke Hillebrandt](http://uke.pm). He does in-depth research into high-impact charitable opportunities. I do the tech side. We've moved tens of thousands of dollars to highly-effective charities.
* [EA Work Club](http://eawork.club) is a 'job board' for effective altruists. I don't do much curation - I just let the EA community post whatever they jobs or projects they think would be relevant to other EAs.
