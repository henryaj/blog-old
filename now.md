# Now

<small>Last updated: July 2019</small>

## üåç Where

I'm in London, sharing a flat with my brother in Elephant & Castle.

## üíº Work

I'm a **back-end developer** at [Thought Machine](http://thoughtmachine.net), working on infrastructure, build systems, internal tooling and such. We're hiring!

## ‚úçÔ∏è Projects

* [Let's Fund](http://lets-fund.org) is a crowdfunding site I started with [Hauke Hillebrandt](http://uke.pm). He does in-depth research into high-impact charitable opportunities. I do the tech side. We've moved tens of thousands of dollars to highly-effective charities.
* [EA Work Club](http://eawork.club) is a 'job board' for effective altruists. I don't do much curation - I just let the EA community post whatever they jobs or projects they think would be relevant to other EAs.

## ‚úàÔ∏è Travel

Went to NYC earlier in the year for [Never Graduate Week](https://twitter.com/recursecenter/status/1129508039336321025) and to catch up with Recurse Center buddies. Heading to SF and California for a week in September.

I did a bit of solo travel this year, too, but I wasn't stoked about it. I think I really _want_ to enjoy it, but in reality I just find it lonely. I much prefer travelling with someone I know, or being able to spend time visiting friends at my destination.
