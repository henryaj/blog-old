# Pause

_[Queen Square](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=National+Hospital+for+Neurology+and+Neurosurgery,+Camden+Town,+WC1,+UK&hl=en&cd=1&ei=nldwS9SQJoSnjAftnKCuBg&sig2=S9kUhNjWUiXZ7ttwpBa9AA&sll=51.521855,-0.123328&sspn=0.003605,0.012295&ie=UTF8&view=map&cid=1156136168223981230&ved=0CBwQpQY&hq=National+Hospital+for+Neurology+and+Neurosurgery,+Camden+Town,+WC1,+UK&hnear=&ll=51.522363,-0.122695&spn=0.00721,0.016415&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A), London._

It seems strange that, though this square is almost totally silent—not a car and barely a person in sight—I am metres away from hundreds of people, mostly very unwell, lying or sleeping silently in their beds. Most of humanity, and most phases of our lives, are so loud and violent that it seems eerie that so many people could so resign themselves to silence.
