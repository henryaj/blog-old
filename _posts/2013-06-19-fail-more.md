# Fail more.

I saw Neil Gaiman speak recently. He was as eloquent on stage as you'd expect, and an answer to one particular audience question reminded of [a New Year Wish of his](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/12/my-new-year-wish.html): 

> I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something. So that's my wish for you, and all of us, and my wish for myself. Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before. Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, or it isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life. Whatever it is you're scared of doing, Do it.

Conversely, if you aren't failing, you are seriously underestimating the extent of your skills and how far you could be stretching yourself.
