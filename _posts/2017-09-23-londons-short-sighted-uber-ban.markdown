The Uber ban is bad news.

I know more than one person with a disability or chronic illness who relies on Uber â€“ to see friends, to get to work, to get to medical appointments. Those people are literally only able to get around using Uber. They lose a lifeline if Uber is gone, as do thousands of drivers.

Uber also saves lives. [Research by Dills and Mulholland](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2783797) finds that the rate of vehicle accidents, assaults and public order offences drops considerably when Uber enters a city.

TfL could have demanded reforms if it wanted to. Instead, it gave Uber one minute's notice of the decision before going public with it. [Other companies](https://blog.taxify.eu/2017/09/bringing-fairer-ride-hailing-to-london/) have tried to bring innovation to London's taxi market and been brought to their knees by TfL's vindictiveness.

I've seen plenty of people enjoy watching Uber squirm. I look forward to hearing what they're proposing should fill the gap.
