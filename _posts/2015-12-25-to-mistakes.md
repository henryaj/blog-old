# To mistakes

As 2015 comes to an end, I'm reminded of Neil Gaiman's [paean to failure](http://journal.neilgaiman.com/2011/12/my-new-year-wish.html). It seems a fitting end to a year â€“ to be reminded of how to go about the next. 

> For this year, my wish for each of us is small and very simple. And it's this. I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're Doing Something. ...

As they say: [if you've never missed a flight, you're spending too much time in airports.](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=40)

> Make your mistakes, next year and forever.

(On a more practical note: I'm [Beeminding mistakes made](https://www.beeminder.com/henryaj/goals/mistakes).)
