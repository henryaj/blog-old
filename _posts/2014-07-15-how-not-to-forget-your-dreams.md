# How not to forget your dreams

> I recently forgot my email password. My security question (set many years ago) was "What do you want to be when you grow up?" I'm unable to recollect my original answer... I wonder how many others lost their way, and whether they ever find their way back to their dream. 1

A friend recently asked for help with a job application. One of the questions asked: _what is your greatest achievement?_ It was a struggle to think of much. Anything would do: good art, or a big project, or teaching myself something substantial. But I didn't have anything. For her, I limply suggested she talk about her success as a 'third culture kid'---integrating herself not only into her parents' cultures but as a transplant in a new culture (she was schooled partly in England and partly in Belgium). But this hardly feels like a triumph. [Generation Y was the first to have to write their own biographies](http://casnocha.com/2010/05/the-age-of-early-selfconception.html). Paul Graham flipped the five most common regrets of the dying and [turned them into daily commands](http://paulgraham.com/todo.html). Maybe asking probing questions of yourself is a useful tool to help find out what you want, or at least to show you that you [don't yet know what you want](http://henrystanley.com/2013/06/20/i-know-i-dont-know-what-i-want/).
