# Beating PRISM with Hemlis

Via [TNW](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/07/10/hemlis/): 

> Peter Sunde, one of the founders of Pirate Bay, has launched a crowdsourced funding program to release Heml.is, a messaging service that seeks to evade government monitoring programs by using end-to-end encryption[.]

It'll be free and and open-source when it comes out, with paid add-ons for extra functionality. And before anyone says it's form over function: it needs to be beautiful if there's going to be significant uptake, which is exactly what encrypted communications needs. I've [donated](https://heml.is/).
