# State of the Union: programming professionally in 2016

Stack Overflow released their latest [annual developer survey](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016) last month. (For any non-programmers reading: Stack Overflow is a website where you can ask questions about programming. For many programming problems, the answer will already be up there. It's an amazing resource that almost everyone in the industry uses.) A few key points stood out for me. **[Education](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education): 43% of programmers have a BA or BS in Computer Science or a related field.** This is a much smaller number than I would have guessed. It's amazing to think that most programmers don't have a CS degree. The survey methodology has changed from last year, when respondents could only pick one option for their education, Maybe I shouldn't be so surprised. During a recent retrospective at Pivotal, I noted that of the handful of people in the room, most either had a degree in a non-CS subject or didn't have a degree at all. **[Bootcamp graduates](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education): 6.5% of developers with over five years' experience have taken a full-time intensive programming course** – that's over 1 in 20, more than I expected. It suggests that bootcamp alumni are finding their feet as professional developers, and shouldn't have problems getting jobs as long as their skills stay relevant. [Bootcamp graduates' salaries are 20% above average](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#salary-per-education) – a similar uplift to having a CS PhD. **[Salary by gender](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#salary-gender): there's no gender pay gap for young developers in the US – but there's a significant pay gap for those above 30.** The effect is smaller, but still significant, when comparing by years of experience instead of age. **[Gender balance by age](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#female-developers-age): women make up much more of the youngest and oldest age groups than those in the middle.** The peak in the over-60 age group certainly corresponds to the 1980s peak – and subsequent collapse – in [the number of women taking CS degrees](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding), and when those women would have entered the workforce. Perhaps we're seeing an uptick in the number of women entering the industry. **[The stack](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-per-occupation): JavaScript is the most used technology by front-end, back-end and full-stack developers.** Wat.
