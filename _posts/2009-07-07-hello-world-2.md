So, here it is. The very first in what will hopefully become a long line of posts.

Ultimately, I want this to become a corner of the internet I can call my own—part stream of consciousness, part formal essays. The idea that this domain has been unused for years surprises me a little when I think of it, as I classically enjoyed tinkering with my website and showing off my work. Some _frisson_ of self-consciousness must have brought an end to that as it has most of my online projects, but here I am again, come full circle, with a website once more—hopefully a little more refined than the hand-codings of a thirteen-year-old—and with it a new-found [online presence](http://twitter.com/henryaj).

In a few hours’ time this post will be indexed and cached by Google and the Internet Archive, a fossilised carbon copy of this tract. To some that immortality might be reason alone to publish; to me it’s a reason not to. But then, [everyone is afraid of sucking](http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/maxfuncon-merlin-mann-doing-creative-work-sound-young-america). And everyone is afraid of starting. So let’s begin.
