# Do the groundwork, but keep the vision in mind

Tackle big projects by taking the time to [build the required 'small skills'](http://lesswrong.com/lw/58m/build_small_skills_in_the_right_order/). But at the same time, [keep one eye on the prize](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/01/checklist-best/). 

> Merely deciding you’re committed for the long-term vs the short-term makes an enormous difference. [In the study] progress was determined not by any measurable aptitude or trait, but by a tiny, powerful idea the child had before even starting lessons. The differences were staggering. With the same amount of practice, the long-term-commitment group outperformed the short-term-commitment group by 400 percent. The long-term-commitment group, with a mere twenty minutes of weekly practice, progressed faster than the short-termers who practiced for an hour and a half. When long-term commitment combined with high levels of practice, skills skyrocketed.
