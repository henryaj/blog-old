# I know I don't know what I want

I'm trying to be more open to the idea that I don't know what I want. It's easy to get swept up and inherit other people's values wholesale; pause for a moment to reflect on what you really want, or how to find that out. 

> To be mature you have to realize what you value most. It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity. They seem never to have paused to consider what has value for them. They spend great effort and sometimes make great sacrifices for values that, fundamentally, meet no real needs of their own. Perhaps they have imbibed the values of their particular profession or job, of their community or their neighbors, of their parents or family. Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one’s own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for. _—Eleanor Roosevelt_
