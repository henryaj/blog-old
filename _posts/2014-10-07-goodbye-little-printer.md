**SUBJECT**: Little Printer love from a floor down

Hey guys,

I'm currently a student at Makers Academy – we're on the floor below you in Epworth House. One of the students here has a Little Printer; every morning I see a little chit pinned to the reception desk with today's top stories from Hacker News and the latest trending GitHub repo...

I was gutted to hear that you're shutting your doors. How's finding a home for Little Printer and its infrastructure going? I've no doubt if you open-sourced it there would be a hugely active community of hackers to support and build on your great work – us Makers would happily count ourselves among them.

All the best,

Henry
