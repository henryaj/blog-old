# An eternal golden braid

From [Life Is a Braid in Spacetime](http://nautil.us/issue/29/scaling/life-is-a-braid-in-spacetime-rp) by Max Tegmark: 

> When we think about the present, we mean the time slice through spacetime corresponding to the time when weâ€™re having that thought. We refer to the future and past as the parts of spacetime above and below this slice. [Spacetime as a mathematical structure implies a] universe that can be beautifully described by mathematics. That this is true for our universe has become increasingly clear over the centuries, with evidence piling up ever more rapidly. The latest triumph in this area is the discovery of the Higgs boson, which, just like the planet Neptune and the radio wave, was first predicted with a pencil, using mathematical equations. This view of ourselves as ... patterns in spacetime challenges the assumption that we can never understand consciousness. It optimistically suggests that consciousness can one day be understood as a form of matter, a derivative of the most beautifully complex spacetime structure in our universe. Such understanding would enlighten our approaches to animals, unresponsive patients, and future ultra-intelligent machines, with wide-ranging ethical, legal, and technological implications. 

Well worth reading.
