The Uber ban is bad news.

I know more than one person with a disability or chronic illness who relies on Uber – to see friends, to get to work, to get to medical appointments. Those people are literally only able to get around using Uber. They lose a lifeline if Uber is gone, as do thousands of drivers.

Uber also saves lives. [Research by Dills and Mulholland](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2783797) finds that the rate of vehicle accidents, assaults and public order offences drops considerably when Uber enters a city.

Transport for London could have demanded reforms if it wanted to. Instead, it gave Uber one minute's notice of the decision before going public with it. [Other companies](https://blog.taxify.eu/2017/09/bringing-fairer-ride-hailing-to-london/) have tried to bring innovation to London's taxi market and been brought to their knees by TfL's vindictiveness.

To some extent I think their flouting of the rules has been a good thing. I was surprised that the LTDA lost a case against them [alleging that Uber uses the driver's mobile phone as a taximeter](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11935513/uber-minicabs-high-court-ruling-victory-london.html) (which it clearly does!) – but it's totally changed the shape of the market, and I believe for the better.

I've seen plenty of people enjoy watching Uber squirm. I look forward to hearing what they're proposing should fill the gap – but given that nothing similar existed before Uber, it's not clear that anything will.

TfL hasn't given out much information on the decision, but they mention:

- Uber's use of Greyball in London – [an independent review has already found that they didn't use it](http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-exec-we-didnt-use-greyball-to-evade-uk-regulators-2017-9)
- Uber's approach to DBS checks – which are done by a government-owned company, as part of individuals getting a private hire licence, so not clear what Uber has to do with it
- Uber's approach to medical checks – doctors were accepting bribes to give drivers a clean bill of health, but they were [doing the same for other minicab firms](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1897962/investigation-reveals-dodgy-gps-getting-cash-to-help-minicab-and-uber-drivers-fake-medical-test-over-fitness-to-drive/), and again I don't see how it's Uber's problem (any more than me going to the doctor and paying for a forged sick note to play hookey)
- Uber's approach to reporting criminal offices – which is definitely awful (and far too slow), but there only seems to be a [single case of them failing to report a serious assault to the police](http://uk.businessinsider.com/met-police-letter-uber-doesnt-report-serious-crimes-2017-8), the other one involving a [legal self-defence dye spray, not pepper spray](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/uber-failing-to-report-sex-attacks-by-drivers-says-met-police) as the Met alleged
