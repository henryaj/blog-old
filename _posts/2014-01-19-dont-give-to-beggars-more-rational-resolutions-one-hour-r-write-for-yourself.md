# Links #1: Don't give to beggars, more rational resolutions, one hour R, write for yourself

_Choice bits of the Internet._ Alyssa Frazee shows how to [teach R to a non-programmer in an hour](http://alyssafrazee.com/introducing-R.html). I've also been having fun with Code School's free [Try R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/) course. Matt Mullenweg writes about [The Intrinsic Value of Blogging](http://ma.tt/2014/01/intrinsic-blogging/): 

> We’ve gotten better at counting [likes, +1s] and worse at paying attention to what really counts. The antidote I’ve found for this is to write for only two people. First, write for yourself[.] ... Second, write for a single person who you have in mind as the perfect person to read what you write, almost like a letter...

Angela Chen at the _Wall Street Journal_ [attends a CFAR rationality workshop](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303453004579290510733740616) and outlines some of the exercises they did: 

> "I learned that if I want Max to do something in December, I should think about December Max as a different person," he says. Instead of just putting a reminder to do something in a few months, he'll plan ahead and send email reminders and incentives for his "future self."

Dave Hill at _The Guardian_ [implores us not to give money to beggars](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/06/dont-give-money-beggars-help-them): 

> For 10 years Thames Reach and others have been trying to persuade us that handing loose change to sad, dishevelled, beseeching suitors on high streets does more harm than good ... "because of the incontrovertible evidence that the vast majority of people begging on the streets are doing so in order to purchase hard drugs". ... If you want to help with money, give it to a relevant charity.

How have I never heard of [this](https://www.hackerschool.com/about) before?: 

> Hacker School is a free, full-time, immersive school in New York for becoming a better programmer. We're like a writers' retreat for programmers.
