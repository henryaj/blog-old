# Employed!

An update to my [becoming](http://henrystanley.com/2014/08/25/the-twelve-second-code-year-part-1/) [a](http://henrystanley.com/2014/09/07/the-twelve-second-code-year-part-2/) [developer](http://henrystanley.com/2014/09/29/the-twelve-second-code-year-part-3/) [saga](http://henrystanley.com/2014/11/05/the-twelve-second-code-year-part-4/) – I'm now working as a software engineer at startup [MyGravity](http://mygravity.co). I get to work with a great team, hacking on Ruby, Grape, systems architecture and other fun things. I'm not sure I ever really believed it would happen, but here I am: a _bona fide_ developer. It's pretty sweet. ([We're hiring](https://angel.co/mygravity/jobs), by the way.)
