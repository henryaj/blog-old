I've suffered from insomnia for as long as I can remember – certainly since I was a teenager. Melatonin has provided some relief, putting me to sleep more quickly and deeply. It's safe to use daily for up to three months; more research is needed on long-term use.[^buscemi] Melatonin is a tricky to obtain: it's not available in the UK, though you can buy it over-the-counter in the US (and can [import it into the UK](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-az/medicines-why-are-some-not-available-in-the-uk-762721.html)). My summary:

* the most effective dose is **0.3mg**[^zhdanova]
* taken **1–2 hours before bedtime**[^ferracioli]

Melatonin sold over-the-counter tends to come in very large doses. Buy the lowest dose you can find, likely 1mg, and use a pill cutter to get to the required dose (I take 0.25mg). Gwern has written a [very comprehensive article on melatonin](https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin) for those interested.
